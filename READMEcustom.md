## My process

I made pretty good progress, my CSS is WAY better than i used to.

Surprisingly i made the challenge in 2 days only! I was that i finished it this fast.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned LOTS of new things, it was pretty fun here are some examples of things that were new for me:

How to center a div:

```html
<div class="div-example">
  <p>Hello! How are you?</p>
</div>
```
```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}

.div-example {
  height: 200px;
  width: 200px;
  background-color: #36559c;
}
```

How to make an image, div, or anything round:

```html
<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/45201/kitty-cat-kitten-pet-45201.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=pexels-pixabay-45201.jpg&fm=jpg">
```

```css
img {
  border-radius: 50px;
}
```

How to import custom fonts:

```html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
```

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap');

h1 {
  font-family: Outfit, Arial;
}
```

### Continued development

1. Using flexbox more often 
2. Using js
3. Using the html tag ```<main>``` and ```<section>``` 
4. Trying for atleast 1 project to NOT look up anything

### Useful resources

- [Stack over flow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - for helping me solve programming problems and in finding solutions

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - for finding inspiration

- [Google](https://google.com/) - helped me also look for coding problems and their solutions and most importantly helped me in learning new things!

Here are some of my best tips for making projects and big websites:

1. Breaks - taking breaks can help relax your brain and staying focused to cpompleting your goal

2. Inspiration - taking inspiration is a big part of ANY project, you can get inspired from many things such as a website, someone else's code, nature, apps, anything!

3. Recreation - recreating your favorite website or recreating someone else's website can also help with inspiration and learning new things!

4. Motivation - without motivation you won't achieve anything! you MUST have motivation to work on something, if the thing that your making isn't your thing leave it! look for something new that motivates you to keep working and go back again to keep working!
